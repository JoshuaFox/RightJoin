				<h1>Personal identification information</h1>
				<p>
					We may collect personal identification information from Users in a variety of ways, including,
					but not limited to, when Users visit our site, register on the site, fill out a form, sign in with Open Authentication (OAuth) 
					from Google+, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, or Linked in, and

					desired benefits, career goals, compensation requirements,
					online professional profiles, photos first and last names, and a phone number.
					Employers may be asked for information including their email address, name, LinkedIn profile URL, organization name,
					and organization URL, and logo, as well as a description of the jobs for which they seek employees, and a link to their job
					ads hosted elsewhere.
					Recruiters may be asked for the same information, as well as the organization name and organization URL for the hiring company.
					All users may, however, visit our Site anonymously.
					We will collect personal identification information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us.
					Users can always refuse to supply personally identification information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Site related activities.
				</p>

				<h1>Non-personal identification information</h1>
				<p>

					We may collect non-personal identification information about Users whenever they interact with our Site.
					Non-personal identification information may include the browser name, the type of computer
					and technical information about Users' means of connection to our Site, such as the
					operating system, approximate geographical location, the Internet service providers utilized, and other similar information.
				</p>

				<h1>Web browser cookies</h1>
				<p>
					Our Site may use "cookies" to enhance User experience. User's web browser places cookies on their
					hard drive for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information about them.
					User may choose to set their web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent.
					If they do so, note that some parts of the Site may not function properly.
				</p>

				<h1>How we use collected information</h1>
				<p>
					<%= Constants::SITENAME%> may collect and use Users' personal information for the following purposes:
				</p>

				<ul class="bullet-points">
					<li>
						<i>To improve customer service</i>
						<p>
							Information you provide helps us respond to your customer service requests and support needs more efficiently.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>To personalize user experience</i>
						<p>
							We may use information in the aggregate to understand how our Users as a group use the services and resources provided on our Site.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>To improve our Site</i>
						<p>
							We may use feedback you provide to improve our products and services.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>To send periodic emails</i>

						<p>
							We may use the email address to send User information and updates
							pertaining to their profile, job postings, and correspondence
							with employers/candidates, including notification of potential matches with
							candidates/employers. (Such email messages will preserve anonymity and privacy
							in the same way as the rest of the site.) The email address may also be used to respond to their inquiries, questions, and/or other requests.
							They may receive infrequent emails that may include <company <%= Constants::SITENAME%> news and updates.
							</p>
							</li>

							<li>
							<i>To put employers and candidates in touch</i>
							<p>
							Candidates are anonymous until they choose to move forward with a specific employer by contacting them.
							</p>
							<p>
							Employers and others can freely search the anonymous profiles, which include
							current job title, desired current job title, professional skills, and their
							desired job title, location, and benefits, as well as optional free-text.
							These anonymous profiles may also be used by us to recommend a candidate to an employer,
							or to recommend a job to a candidate.
							</p>
							<p>
							Also, employees and others can freely search the job listings, which are linked to job ads outside the site
							and which include the title, city, and short job description.
							</p>
							<p>
							Identifying  information on employers is not searchable.
							It may be shown to a candidate after an employer or recruiter chooses to send a job offer to that candidate.
							In that case, the candidate will see the employer's name, company, and LinkedIn profile URL, as
							well as the name of the hiring company, if different. If the employer or recruiter
							provides a URL for their company or for the hiring
							company, if different, the candidate will see those. The candidate will also see the job description of the opportunity that
							they received.
							</p>
							   	
							</li>
							<li>
							<i>To summarize recent usage</i>

							<p>
							Site visitors may also see a list of names of companies using the site.
							Site visitors may also see an anonymized summary of
							recent new candidates, with the same information as in the search results, described above,
							and an anonymized statement that a given employer has
							contacted a candidate, mentioning only the candidate's current position and the name of the employer. In any case,
							the site will never list the name of the company's representative, their URL, the proposed new job position,
							nor any other information on job positions
							created and/or sent to candidates. Any content of the communication between candidate and employer will likewise
							be kept strictly private.
							</p>
							</li>

							</ul>

							<h1>How we protect your information</h1>
							<p>
							We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect
							against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, username, password,
							transaction information and data stored on our Site.
							</p>

							<h1>Sharing your personal information</h1>
							<p>
							We do not sell, trade, or rent User's personal identification information to others.
							We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal identification
							information regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above.
							</p>
							<h1>Merger, acquisition, or sale</h1>
							<p>
							 If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of <%=Constants::SHORT_SITENAME%>  assets, 
							 we may transfer any personal information in our custody and control to the acquirer.
							 You will be notified via email and/or a notice on  <%=Constants::SITENAME%> of any such transaction.
							</p>
							
							<h1>Third party websites</h1>
							<p>
							Users may find content on our Site that links to the sites and services of our partners,
							suppliers, advertisers, sponsors, licensors and other third parties. We do not control the content or links
							that appear on these sites and are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Site.
							In addition, these sites or services, including their content and links, may be constantly changing.
							These sites and services may have their own privacy policies and customer service policies.
							Browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link to our Site,
							is subject to that website's own terms and policies.
							</p>

							<h1>Compliance with children's online privacy protection act</h1>
							<p>
							Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important.
							For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our Site from those we actually know are under 13,
							and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.
							</p>

							<h1>Changes to this privacy policy</h1>

							<%= Constants::SITENAME%> has the discretion to update this privacy policy at any time.
							When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page.
