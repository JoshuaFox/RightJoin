			Why <%= Constants::SHORT_SITENAME%>?
		</h1>
		<p>
			<%= Constants::SHORT_SITENAME%> helps development teams connect and engage with top engineers in a comfortable and informal way.
			It's peer-to-peer recruiting combined with the world's best job ad.
			Our solution attracts &ldquo;stealth&rdquo; candidates, the ones who <em>don't</em> talk to  recruiters.

			<h3 class="standard-section-header collapsed">How is <%= Constants::SHORT_SITENAME%> different?</h3>
			<div class="accordion-panel">
				<p>
					Opening a dialog with employed, experienced software engineers through normal channels is almost impossible.
					Think how many great engineers  don’t read ads and don’t pay attention to sourcing spam.
					They never talk with recruiters unless they absolutely have to.
				</p>
				<p>
					These engineers  stick to their own networks for future jobs, just as you plumb your networks for future hires.
					Meanwhile you mostly talk to candidates churned out by your staffing front-end.
					A  gainfully employed software engineer is not going to want to test your waters
					if the only option is to endure the bureauratic gantlet.
				</p>
				Why can’t engineers talk to each other without involving recruiters? Of course they do, and
				we are extending the personal relationship dialog outside of your existing network.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h3 class="standard-section-header collapsed">How do you  help me attract software developers?</h3>
			<div class="accordion-panel">
				<p>
					We've designed a beautiful job posting that shows employed, experienced software engineers
					the things they want to know about your team.
				</p>
				<p>
					Foremost among these attractions is is your own engineers.
				</p>
				<p>
					When potential employees see this job posting, they  &ldquo;ping&rdquo; your company.
					Your hiring manager then sees the candidate’s LinkedIn profile
					(<%= Constants::SHORT_SITENAME%> also provides  optional screening services), and chooses whether to pass
					the contact over to one of the team for a peer-to-peer conversation.
				</p>

			</div>

			<h3 class="standard-section-header collapsed">How do we get the job posting in front of potential employees?</h3>
			<div class="accordion-panel">
				<ul>
					<li>
						We provide the tools for your team  to share the posting on social media and track progress.
						When a team member shares it, he or she appears at the center&mdash;the messaging here is not &ldquo;Come work for my boss&rdquo;
						but &ldquo;<em>Come Work with Us</em>.&rdquo;
					</li>
					<li>
						We also provide a geotargeted tab for the company website. Clicking on the tab pops up the same beautiful job post
						distributed on all the channels.
					</li>
					<li>
						We can also arrange for the tab to highlight your job openings on professional sites read by millions of software developers.
					</li>
					<li>
						We can distribute your ad to leading job-listing services, like Monster, LinkedIn, and Dice. 
					</li>
					<li>
						The posting can pep up recruitment email; it also appears on <%= Constants::SHORT_SITENAME%>'s own job listing.
					</li>
				</ul>

			<h3 class="standard-section-header collapsed">Why is opening up the corporate culture the way to bring in strong candidates?</h3>
			<div class="accordion-panel">
				<p>
					&ldquo;The <em>best thing</em> you can do for employees&mdash;a perk better than foosball
					or free sushi&mdash;is hire only &lsquo;A&rsquo;-players
					to work alongside them. Excellent colleagues trump everything else&rdquo;
					(<%= link_to "How Netflix Reinvented HR" ,"http://hbr.org/2014/01/how-netflix-reinvented-hr/ar/2" %>,
					<i>Harvard Business Review</i>).
				</p>
				<p>
					Treat current and potential employees like the professionals they are. Let them connect. They'll know where to go from there.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h3 class="standard-section-header collapsed">How can I monitor the effectiveness of my recruiting compaign?</h3>
			<div class="accordion-panel">
				<p>
					Your employer dashboard  presents the most important data points, tracking clickbacks, leads, and other key data.
				</p>
				<p>
					We also send you a weekly summary of the most important numbers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your employees get their own dashboard that show their shares and success in pulling in leads.
				</p>

			</div>

			<h3 class="standard-section-header collapsed">Why don't you provide resum&eacute;s or LinkedIn profiles in the candidate listings?</h3>
			<div class="accordion-panel">
				<p>
					Experienced, employed, developers don't maintain their resum&eacute;s and don't feel like applying to jobs.
					And face it, you hate browsing resum&eacute;s.
				</p>
				<p>
					So, we only require the <em>minimum</em> of information needed for an introduction.
				</p>
				<p>
					You'll get the relevant professional profiles, like LinkedIn or GitHub, when the candidate makes contact.
					That serves for screening. If you want to move ahead, you can ask the candidate for a resum&eacute;.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h3 class="standard-section-header collapsed">What does it cost?</h3>
			<div class="accordion-panel">
				<p>
					<%if signed_in?%>
						You can see the pricing plans on your <%= link_to "profile page", edit_employer_path(current_user, :anchor=>"plans-and-pricing")%>.
					<%else%>
						See the <%= link_to "Get Started", employer_get_started_path(:anchor=>"plans-and-pricing" )%> page for pricing plans.

					Please <%= email_contact_link("contact us") %> for  discounts for pre-paid annual plans.

			<h3 class="standard-section-header collapsed">I'm not hiring right now. Can I freeze my subscription?</h3>
			<div class="accordion-panel">
				 Just close all open job positions. We do not charge for  months in which there are no open jobs.
				 You can simply add job positions to resume your paid plan when you need it again. 
			</div>

			<h3 class="standard-section-header collapsed">Can you support more countries or job categories?</h3>
			<div class="accordion-panel">
				<p>
					We are focusing on software developers, an in-demand profession that we know and love.
					We plan to add more professions once we're sure we can fully serve the demand for recruiting developers.
				</p>
				<p>
					We've been adding new countries over time. The countries we now support are <%= country_links_as_sentence(:path => method(:employer_welcome_path))%>.
