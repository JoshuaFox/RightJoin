OpenDNS is looking for a sharp, experienced Windows software engineer to develop and extend the next wave of endpoint security. This is a chance to work on the team which extends the OpenDNS predictive security model out to the new cloud perimeter.

The office is rich with open spaces for collaboration, the latest tech tools and toys and a fully stocked kitchen to help you recharge. Come work with us, and be part of the team that’s revolutionizing Internet security.

Innovative -- We aren't a social networking or Web 2.0 phphotosharing site. We work on core Internet protocols and make them better.

No ladders to climb -- We keep a relatively flat corporate structure that promotes fast movement and flexible teams.

Meritocracy -- The best ideas win, regardless of where they come from.

Time off to relax -- As a startup, we work our butts off. That's why it's important to get away to clear your mind from time to time. Three weeks and 10 company holidays make that easy.

Technologists -- We are a company of engineers and technologists passionate about delivering a better Internet.

Food -- Hard work makes you hungry. We keep a well-stocked kitchen with catered lunches throughout the week.
